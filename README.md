# CMM
#PACMMA_CSV_Creator.py:
#This is the cumulative file!
#This file must be adjusted to properly represent the potentiometers orientation and robot arm length.
#This is the file intended for the CMM Arm we produced.

#2D_CSV_Creator.py:
#Test file using 2 potentiometers in 2 dimensions of space. I used some pieces of cut up credit cards for this one.

#3DpointsCSV.py:
#Fusion 360 comes with a program that will take a CSV and make a spline. We don't want that, we just want the individual points in 3D #space so this file above will do that for us. Add this to your scripts in Fusion 360 to use.

#3d_functions.py:
#Simply a collection of functions for forward kinematics in 3 dimensions.

#CMM Potentiometer Angle reader:
#This was just me experimenting with the potentiometers just to get some knowledge of working with them.

#MCP3008_setup_ex.py
#By the end of the project we ended up switching to a better ADC so we could take in more data from more potentiometers. This file is #the program, that was available online, that was needed to use it.

#MCP3008_Magnetic_Potentiometer.py:
#This file is an experiment using the new ADC on our new potentiometers (Hall effect encoder to be precise).

#collect.csv:
#You can ignore this. This is a blank file that exists in the Raspberry Pi (you need to create it) and is used to store the data from #the program.
